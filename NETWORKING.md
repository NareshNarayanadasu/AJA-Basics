Azure networks :

Like how we have Multiple phone numbers to contact each other as like that n/w has something called IP Address 
And we have 

IP V4
IP V6
IP V4 

Is usually 8 bit .8bit. 8bit.8bit = 32 bit IP addressing

Here we I can do sub netting and super netting to classify into multiple small pieces of n/w
We have 5 different classes of IP address :
1. A 0-126
2. B 128-191
3. C 192-223
4. D 224-239
5. E 240-255
127 is called loopback IP address

Then IP address are start from 0.0.0.0 , 0.0.0.1,...â€¦........
...to......,255.255.255.255

Then if network is big the we can use 10.1.0.0/16 means that first two blocks are blocked and we can create subnets are 
10.1.1.0/24 means that there is a chance to create 255 subnets

Classifications of IP address :

Public IP

It is mainly for management traffic


Private IP:

If two virtual machines communicating each other then it is always via private IP

We have reserved private IP

1. 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
2. 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
3. 198.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255


Create a new boundary logical boundary which is my recourse group which called N/W boundary
 in the network boundary Iam creating a Vnet with IP Address of 10.1.0.0/16
Everybody in the vnet will communicate each other 
To give some security in my virtual network Iam going to create subnets 
 then my subnets named as s1 and s2 
I will assign ip to s1 is 10.1.1.0/24(within this I can create 256 subnets)
I will assign ip to s1 is 10.1.2.0/24

Azure reserved some IP are 0,1,2,3 and 255
0 is for network 
1,2,3 is for azure for future 
255 is for broadcast IP

Any machine you created that needs a ip address will picked up from subnet address
In this sub net you want to create machines 
Machines will have network interface card NIC
Virtual networks

Machines will have network interface card NIC

Create IP addresses :
 Public IP:
These are accessible for publics from the internet
Private IP:
Which can be only accessible within in a network you cant connect from outside
These Ips can be dynamic and static
Dynamic:
Evrytime the dynamic ip can change (when you assign a dynamic when machines start the ip will change)
Static Ip :
It always remain same (when you start a machine the static ip can be remains same)
IP V6 
It usually has 128 bit alpha numeric IP addressing
