Cloud Computing Services
        
        The three major Cloud Computing Offerings are
            • Software as a Service (SaaS)
            • Platform as a Service (PaaS)
            • Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        
        
    
        
        Software as a Service (SaaS) :
        
            SaaS  is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network (internet).
             ex  : Gmail, fb
            
        PaaS (Platform as a Service) :
        
            it provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. This service is hosted in the cloud and accessed by the users via internet.
            It provides platform to support application development. It includes software support and management services, storage, networking, deploying,
            
            Ex :   
                Google App Engine 
                Microsoft Azure App Service 
                AWS Elastic Beanstalk
        Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
             offers on-demand access to IT infrastructure services, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization.
